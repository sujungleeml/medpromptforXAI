## Well-tempered medical prompt engineering for explainable extubation
This study proposes a method to enhance the interpretability of XGBoost-based models in the field of medical artificial intelligence by utilizing prompt engineering to improve the interpretability of SHAP and given data.

### Project Structure
prompt folder: Contains the before tempering prompt and after tempering prompt.
result folder: Contains the qualitative results of the study. Includes an Excel file comparing the outputs of the before and after tempering prompts for a case with no data provided and test results of TP 10, TN 10, FP 10, and FN 10.
